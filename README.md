Rubik's cube trainer

using html5/javascript and a three.js based cube 

See it live: https://ittayd.github.io/rubiks_trainer/index.html

(Note: originally based on http://cube.vipe.re/ but completely rewritten since then)

This is a pet project for personal use started as a hack. Don't expect great looking code, documentation or modularity....
